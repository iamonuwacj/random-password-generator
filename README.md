# random-password-generator

This project uses vanilla javascript to generate strong and unique passwords automatically

The code has 4 working parts. The display, the option to select the password length, the generate button and the copy password button.

## The display.
This part of the code only does one job which is to hold the generated password. I used an input tag with a readonly attribute to design it.

## Password Length
This aspect of the code is where the user enters how long he wants the generated password to be.

## Generate Button
This button works with the generate password function in the script. Once pressed, it triggers the function and genrates a new password that meets all the criteria. It was clears the password length screen.

## Copy Password.
The generated password cant't go wasted. The copy button once pressed triggers a copy gen password in the script. This function now highlights and copys the generated password to the clipboard.
